***andrew* is a hackable personal assistant**, similar to *[Siri](https://www.apple.com/de/ios/siri/)* or *[Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/)*, but for Nerds. He **interprets your input and processes it using [small plugins](plugins/)**. *andrew* is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and published under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

***andrew* is only a server. To use him conveniently, you need a [client](docs/clients.md).** You could also install *andrew* (the server) on a small server-like machine in your house – for example on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) – and run the client on your local computer.
